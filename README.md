## Body Mass Index Calculator
Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.
## Business Requirement
A program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.It tell us the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
* Under 18.5 they are underweight
* Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
* Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
* Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
* Above 35 they are clinically obese.
## Hint
The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
* Example of expected output: Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.

## Software/Platform
* Python
* Visual Studio Code
